#### Segment HippoCampal using FreeSurfer

It takes about 14 hours on my PC. Related documentation is [HippocampalSubfieldSegmentation](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/HippocampalSubfieldSegmentation).

The HippoCampalSegmentation.sh file integrates all the setting and segmentation commands. Generated Hippocampal results are given as probability maps.
